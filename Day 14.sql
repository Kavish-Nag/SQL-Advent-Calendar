-- Focus Challenge End Dates
-- The Productivity Club is tracking members' challenge start dates and wants to calculate each member's focus_end_date, exactly 14 days after their start date. 
-- Can you write a query to return the existing table with the focus_end_date column?

SELECT *, DATE(start_date, '+14 days') FROM focus_challenges;
